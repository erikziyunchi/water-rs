        WATER-rs provides a Rust runtime for WebAssembly Transport Modules(WATM) as a pluggable application-layer transport protocol provider. It is designed to be highly portable and lightweight, allowing for rapidly deployable pluggable transports. While other pluggable transport implementations require a fresh client deployment (and app-store review) to update their protocol WATER allows dynamic delivery of new transports in real time over the network.<br />

The Go implementation of the runtime library can be found in [water-go](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water). We now also support building WATM in Go, please refer to [watm](https://github.com/refraction-networking/watm) for examples and helper libraries interfacing Pluggable Transports-like interfaces. Official Go compiler is currently not supported until further notice.

## Be Water

> Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.

## Contents

The repo contains 2 main components:
1. A Rust crate [`water`](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs/tree/main/crates/water) runtime library used to interact with `.wasm` WebAssembly Transport Modules(WATM).
2. A Rust crate [`watm_v0`](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs/tree/main/crates/watm_v0) for the v0 WATM-development where developers can easily create their own `.wasm` (the general version of `watm` is still under development).


Also include examples for demonstration of usage:
1. ‚≠ê A standalone [`cli`](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs/tree/main/examples/clients/cli) tool which is compatible with both `v0` and `v1_preview`, and can run all different roles with all of our example WATM binaries.
2. A few examples WATM implementations with `water_wasm` crate, see [water-rs/tree/main/examples/water_bins](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs/tree/main/examples/water_bins).
3. Examples of using the above WATM examples with our `water` library, see [tests](https://github.com/refraction-networking/water-rs/tree/main/tests/tests) for usage.

## Running tests

```sh
# runs ALL tests
cargo test --workspace --verbose

# run tests for a single crate
cargo test -p <crate_name> --verbose

# run a single test (or test matching name prefix) in a single crate
cargo test -p <crate_name> --verbose -- <test_name>
```
