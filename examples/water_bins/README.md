# WATM Examples

This folder is for all the WATM examples that developed using the [WATM library crate](https://github.com/erikziyunchi/water-rs/tree/main/crates/wasm), and runnable with the [WATER library engine](https://github.com/erikziyunchi/water-rs/tree/main/crates/water).

One can find details of these in each examples' README.
